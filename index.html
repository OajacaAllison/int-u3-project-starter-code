        <p>It’s 7:13 AM. Not 7:00. Not 7:15. You never set it to 7:13.</p>
        <p>Your room looks the same as always.</p>
        <p>Whatever. Probably just Monday stuff.</p>

    <p>You ask the principal with genuine concern. He’s touched. His eyes well up.</p>
    <p>He hasn’t felt “seen” in years. You accidentally unlock years of suppressed emotions.</p>
    <p>He starts trauma-dumping about his divorce, his failed screenplay, and his unresolved issues with his father.</p>
    <p>He won’t stop. The bell rings. No one can leave. You are now legally his emotional support student. 
    <p>You’ve been reassigned. You now spend third period in his office. Listening.</p>
